    "# Assume that you are developing a student gradebook system for a school. The system should allow teachers to input student grades for various subjects, store the data in files. and provide students with the ability to view their grades. Design a Python program that accomplishes the following tasks: i. Teachers should be able to input grades for students in different subjects. ii. Store the student grade data in separate text files for each subject. iii. Students should be able to view their grades for each subject. iv. Implement error handling for file operations, such as file not found or permission issues."
